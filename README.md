Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Chris Viviers (@cviviers) 
Iâ€™m interested in building technology that can have lasting societal impact ðŸš€ 
Right now that is applied machine learning research in the medical domain.
I'm currently persuing a PhD at the Technical University of Eindhoven in collaboration with Philips.
