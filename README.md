Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Chris Viviers.<br>

Iâ€™m interested in building technology that can have lasting societal impact ðŸš€ <br>
Right now that is machine learning research and its application in the medical domain.<br>

I'm currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Eindhoven in collaboration with Philips.<br>
